## 1. Overview

The [Velexi Research Project Cookiecutter][vlxi-cookiecutter-research]
is intended to streamline the process of setting up a Jupyter-based research
project. Velexi's standard research project structure is a customization of the
[Cookiecutter Data Science][cookiecutter-data-science] (v1) structure that
add support for Julia and incorporates several ideas from the blog article
["Jupyter Notebook Best Practices for Data Science"][whitmore-2016] by Jonathan
Whitmore.

Features include:

* support for common research workflows (for both individuals and teams);

* a directory structure that organizes and separates different components of a
  research project: datasets, exploration/experimentation (e.g., Jupyter
  notebooks), reports, and software (e.g., custom functions and test code);

* automatic generation of HTML and pure code versions of Jupyter notebooks to
  facilitate review of both (1) research results and (2) implementation;

* Git and DVC integration to encourage code and data version control;

* addition of Python packages for data and experiment management, interactive
  work environments, and code quality;

* support for Julia; and

* directory-based environment isolation for `direnv`-enabled systems.

* `README.md`: this file

* `RELEASE-NOTES.md`: release notes for this repository

* `LICENSE`: license for this repository

* `bin`: directory contianing CLI tools for this repository

  * `create-project`: script to create an empty research project

* `docs`: directory containing cookiecutter documentation and other helpful
  documents

## 2. Usage

1. Clone this repository.

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/velexi-corporation/VLXI-Cookiecutter-Research.git
   ```

2. (OPTIONAL) Use `direnv` to set up a Python virtual environment for the
   cookiecutter.

    * Copy `templates/dot-envrc` to `.envrc` in root directory.

    * Grant permission to `direnv` to execute the `.envrc` file.

      ```shell
      $ direnv allow
      ```

3. Install required Python packages.

   ```shell
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Use the `create-project` CLI tool to create a new empty research project
   directory. In the following command, replace `PROJECT_NAME` with the name
   of the new research project.

   ```shell
   $ bin/create-project PROJECT_NAME
   ```

   To create a project with Julia support, use the following command.

   ```shell
   $ bin/create-project -j PROJECT_NAME
   ```

   __Notes__

   * The `create-project` CLI tool supports several command-line options. Use
     `create-project --help` to see a full list of options.

   * The directory containing the new research project is relocateable. It has
     no dependency on this cookiecutter package.

5. Customize the new research project.

   * Update the `README.md` file.

   * In the `LICENSE` file, update the year and name of the copyright owner.
     Depending on the license type selected, these these parameters may appear

     * within brackets (e.g., `[year]`) or

     * as the current year (e.g., 2022) and the pre-formatted string
       "Your name (or your organization/company/team)".

   * In the `setup.py` file, update the arguments of the `setup()` function.

   * Review `requirements.txt` and update the package requirements for the
     project.

   * If the project was created with Julia support enabled, update the package
     requirements for the project via the Julia REPL.
